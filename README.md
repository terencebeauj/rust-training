# Exercises in Rust

This repo contains a list of exercises generated by GPT-4, tracking my progress through `The Rust Programming Language` book.
Every time I finish a chapter, I ask GPT-4 to generate me a list of exercises based on the chapter, to be sure that I get sufficient exposure to all those new concepts.
